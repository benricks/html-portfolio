<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Benjamin Rick Coen, I am a software developer with a degree in Business. While learning about the ins and outs of entertainment business at 
  Emerson College, I decided that I wanted to pursue programming languages as an additional skill. As I started to delve deeper into Python and JavaScript, I realized
  that knowing these skills is a great combination to have in any industry and especially the entertainment business industry. 
</p>

<p>I am proficient in Python as well as JavaScript and am trying to become a FullStack Developer at the current time.</p>

<p>I am in my senior year of College and am focusing all of my free time on mastering Python and JavaScript.</p>
