<h1>Best Movies of 2024: According to Ben Rick</h1>
<h2>These are the top three movies of 2024 ranked in order!</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<p>Honestly, one of the best scifi movies I have ever seen. <br />
    Visual effects were off the charts. <br> Timothy Chalamet really showed his acting prowess.</p>
<h3>Civil War</h3>
<p>Civil War was an action packed movie with some of the most realistic military combat and warzone scenes and sequences that I have ever seen. <br />Although on most years this would not make the top 3. <br />Beacuse of the lackluster films this year. Civil War's brilliant sound design takes the cake.</p>
<h3>Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
<p>I am a sucker for Wolverine and I absolutely love the Deadpool franchise. <br> While this movie was definetly a fan service circus. <br> I loved every second of it.</p>
